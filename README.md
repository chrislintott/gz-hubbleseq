Notes

Comments from Bill at GZ10: 

 * Not how Sandage described the process. Sandage had larger scale plates. 
 * de Vaucouleur did tend to favour bulge size. 

Comments from Bill by email:

“Let me cheerlead for the idea of revisiting the 2014 draft. Tis is a major thing in classical morphology. We might be able to consider whether
there are visual biases from photographs that could have led to Hubble’s view (and in fact trace where that appeared historically), since
use of bulge prominence predates practically all photographic photometry and quantitative decomposition. For example, there
are spirals with very luminous bulges but large scale length for the bulge (NGC 3521 was my standard example, but the amateur
deep imaging coordinated by Gonzalez-Delgado may show that to be tidal structure rather than a genuine relaxed bulge). NGC 7331
is kind of similar in that way.”

Kormendy \& Bender (2012) - “everything that is not forbidden is mandatory” (when it comes to galaxy evolution processes). 

Hart et al. 2016: 
“Galaxy stellar mass is known to correlate with galaxy mor- phology (Bamford et al. 2009; Kelvin et al. 2014b), and spi- ral galaxy Hubble type (Mun ̃oz-Mateos et al. 2015).”


Dobbs & Baba 2015
“Although the pitch angle is histor- ically used to classify galaxies according to the Hubble sequence, the differences in spiral arm shape, i.e. the pitch angle of the spiral arms appears to be most de- pendent on the maximum rotation velocity, and thus the local shear in the disc, rather than the global mass dis- tribution (Kennicutt, 1981; Kennicutt & Hodge, 1982; Garcia Gomez & Athanassoula, 1993; Seigar & James, 1998; Seigar et al., 2006). For example Figures 8 and 10 of Kennicutt (1981) show that the pitch angle corre- lates much better with the maximum rotational velocity than the properties of the bulge. However there is still considerable scatter (see Figure 7 of Kennicutt 1981)”
