Notes

Comments from Bill at GZ10: 

 * Not how Sandage described the process. Sandage had larger scale plates. 
 * de Vaucouleur did tend to favour bulge size. 

Comments from Bill by email:

“Let me cheerlead for the idea of revisiting the 2014 draft. Tis is a major thing in classical morphology. We might be able to consider whether
there are visual biases from photographs that could have led to Hubble’s view (and in fact trace where that appeared historically), since
use of bulge prominence predates practically all photographic photometry and quantitative decomposition. For example, there
are spirals with very luminous bulges but large scale length for the bulge (NGC 3521 was my standard example, but the amateur
deep imaging coordinated by Gonzalez-Delgado may show that to be tidal structure rather than a genuine relaxed bulge). NGC 7331
is kind of similar in that way.”

Kormendy \& Bender (2012) - “everything that is not forbidden is mandatory” (when it comes to galaxy evolution processes).
