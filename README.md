Notes

Comments from Bill at GZ10: 

 * Not how Sandage described the process. Sandage had larger scale plates. 
 * de Vaucouleur did tend to favour bulge size. 

Kormendy \& Bender (2012) - “everything that is not forbidden is mandatory” (when it comes to galaxy evolution processes). 


For Sam - conclusions of Kormendy \& Bender (2012) state that AGN feedback unlikely to be important for dwarf galaxies.
